Known issues:
- Projects located on shared drives (completion problems, SWC parsing crash,...)
- Very limited FlexBuilder projects support
- Some completion/generator problems with SWCs
- Selecting several FLA files and pressing <Enter>: execution not properly queued
- QuickBuild does not work if class is packaged

Code refactoring plans:

- Rename class file to rename in code
- Duplicate class with new name (would rename in the code too)
- Imports automatic cleanup
- Package refactoring
- For more, we need a complete AST

Flex compilation improvements:
- Conditional compilation constants in projects (http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/compilers_21.html)
- SWF metadata options in projects (title, description, ..)
- Link-report/excludes options in projects
- Framework caching

Completion improvements:

- Configure completion list's insertion trigger characters
- ASCompletion exclusions settings
- Better completion support for timeline code
- Smarter function generator (detect parameters type)
- Option to generate get/set after the private var
- Show event types after addEventListener(
- Add an option to use only package imports (com.domain.package.*)
- Inheritance level browsing with completion lists?
- Inheritance explorer: display a type's super & sub classes

Snippets improvements:

- More arguments (http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=3661)
- Arguments operations (uppercase, lowercase, substr, repeat,...)
- Argument to generate import declarations
- Tabbing in placeholder arguments (as in Eclipse, Textmate,...)

Future features:

- Installer(?) and update process for thirdparty plugins
- Back/forward buttons to navigate in code (like in VS)
- Xml beautifier/checker
- Other language completion & projects (JS, etc)
- Finish haXe projects support (platforms, directives, makefile)
- Bandwidth simulation? (would "just" require a custom http server)
- Centralize few ScintillaNET global settings...
- TortoiseSVN/CVS/VSS Context menu integration
- Filtering/tabs to results panel? (all, errors, info, todo)
- Open file from selected text in code
