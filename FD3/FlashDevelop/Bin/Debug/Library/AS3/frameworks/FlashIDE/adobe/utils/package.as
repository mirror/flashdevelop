	 * Lets you issue Flash JavaScript API (JSAPI) commands from ActionScript.
	 *  In Flash CS3, the MMExecute() function can be called only by a movie that
	 *  is used as a Flash Panel, by an XMLtoUI dialog box, or by the Custom UI
	 *  of a component. JSAPI commands have no effect in the player, in test movie mode,
	 *  or outside the authoring environment.
	 *  The Flash JSAPI provides several objects, methods, and properties to duplicate
	 *  or emulate commands that a user can enter in the authoring environment. Using the JSAPI,
	 *  you can write scripts that extend Flash in several ways: adding commands to menus,
	 *  manipulating objects on the Stage, repeating sequences of commands, and so on.
	 *
	 * @param name              <String> A string passed to MMExecute(). MMExecute() parses the string and
	 *                            executes any JavaScript commands.
	 *                            You can assign the string a variable and then pass the variable to MMExecute(). You can also
	 *                            separate your JavaScript function into smaller strings;
	 *                            MMExecute() returns the value of the last function called.
	 * @return                  <String> A string representation of the result, if any, sent by the JavaScript statement.
