	 *  An event sent between DragManagers that are 
 *  in separate but trusted ApplicationDomains to
 *  handle the dispatching of DragEvents to the drag targets.
 *  One DragManager has a DragProxy that moves with 
 *  the mouse and looks for changes to the dropTarget.
 *  It cannot directly dispatch the DragEvent to a potential
 *  target in another ApplicationDomain because code
 *  in that ApplicationDomain would not type-match on DragEvent.
 *  Instead, the DragManager dispatches a InterDragManagerEvent
 *  that the other ApplicationDomain's DragManager listens
 *  for and it marshals the DragEvent and dispatches it to
 *  the potential dropTarget.
