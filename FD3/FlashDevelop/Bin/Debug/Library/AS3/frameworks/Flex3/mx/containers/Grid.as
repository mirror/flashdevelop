	 *  A Grid container lets you arrange children as rows and columns *  of cells, similar to an HTML table.  *  The Grid container contains one or more rows, and each row can contain *  one or more cells, or items. You use the following tags to define a Grid control: * *  <ul> *     <li>The <code>&lt;mx:Grid&gt;</code> tag defines a Grid container.</li> *  *     <li>The <code>&lt;mx:GridRow&gt;</code> tag defines a grid row,  *     which has one or more cells. The grid row must be a child of the  *     <code>&lt;Grid&gt;</code> tag.</li> *  *     <li>The <code>&lt;mx:GridItem&gt;</code> tag defines a grid cell, *     and must be a child of the <code>&lt;GridRow&gt;</code> tag. *     The <code>&lt;mx:GridItem&gt;</code> tag can contain *     any number of children.</li> *  </ul> *  *  <p>The height of all the cells in a single row is the same, *  but each row can have a different height.  *  The width of all cells in a single column is the same, *  but each column can have a different width.  *  You can define a different number of cells *  for each row or each column of the Grid container.  *  In addition, a cell can span multiple columns *  or multiple rows of the container.</p> *   *  <p>The Grid, GridRow, and GridItem containers have the following default sizing characteristics:</p> *     <table class="innertable"> *        <tr> *           <th>Characteristic</th> *           <th>Description</th> *        </tr> *        <tr> *           <td>Grid height</td> *           <td>The sum of the default or explicit heights of all rows plus the gaps between rows.</td> *        </tr> *        <tr> *           <td>Grid width</td> *           <td>The sum of the default or explicit width of all columns plus the gaps between columns.</td> *        </tr> *        <tr> *           <td>Height of each row and each cell</td> *           <td>The default or explicit height of the tallest item in the row. If a GridItem container does not  *               have an explicit size, its default height is the default or explicit height of the child in the cell.</td> *        </tr> *        <tr> *           <td>Width of each column and each cell</td> *           <td>The default or explicit width of the widest item in the column. If a GridItem container does not have an explicit  *               width, its default width is the default or explicit width of the child in the cell.</td> *        </tr> *        <tr> *           <td>Gap between rows and columns</td> *           <td>Determined by the horizontalGap and verticalGap properties of the Grid class. The default value for both  *               gaps is 6 pixels.</td> *        </tr> *        <tr> *           <td>Default padding</td> *           <td>0 pixels for the top, bottom, left, and right values, for all three container classes.</td> *        </tr> *     </table> * *  @mxml * *  <p>The <code>&lt;mx:Grid&gt;</code> tag inherits all of the tag  *  attributes of its superclass, except the <code>Box.direction</code> *  property, and adds the following tag attributes:</p> *   *  <pre> *  &lt;mx:Grid *    <strong>Styles</strong> *    horizontalGap="8" *    verticalGap="6" *    &gt; *      ... *    <i>These child tags are examples only:</i> *       &lt;mx:GridRow id="row1"&gt; *        &lt;mx:GridItem *          rowSpan="1" *          colSpan="1"> *            &lt;mx:Button label="Button 1"/&gt; *        &lt;/mx:GridItem&gt; *        ... *       &lt;/mx:GridRow&gt; *    ... *  &lt;/mx:Grid&gt; *  </pre> *   *  @includeExample examples/GridLayoutExample.mxml * *  @see mx.containers.GridRow *  @see mx.containers.GridItem
