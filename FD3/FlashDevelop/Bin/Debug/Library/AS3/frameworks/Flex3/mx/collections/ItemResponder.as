	 *  The ItemResponder class provides a default implementation of the *  <code>mx.rpc.IResponder</code> interface. *  It represents a responder that lets you specify methods to be  *  called when a request is completed, either successfully or with an error. *  The class object can also lets you provide data (a token) to be used by *  the responder methods. *  * <p>You use an <code>ItemResponder</code> object in the <code>catch</code> statement * of a try block that might result in getting remote data, as shown in the following * code:</p> *  *  <pre><code> *     import mx.collections.ItemResponder; *     //... * *     try *     { *        //... *        cursor.moveNext(); *     } *	   catch(e:ItemPendingError) *     { *        e.addResponder(new ItemResponder(myResultFunction, myFaultFunction, {info:"..."})); *     } *  </code></pre> * *  <p>The result method specified must have the following signature:</p> *  *  <code><pre> *     public function myResultFunction(result:Object, token:Object = null):void; *  </pre></code> * *  <p>The fault method specified must have the following signature:</p> *  *  <code><pre> *     public function myFaultFunction(error:Object, token:Object = null):void; *  </pre></code> *  *  <p>Any other signature will result in a runtime error.</p> *  *  @see mx.collections.errors.ItemPendingError
