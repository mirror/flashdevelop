	 *  This subclass of Event is dynamic, meaning that you can set *  arbitrary event properties on its instances at runtime. * *  <p>By contrast, Event and its other subclasses are non-dynamic, *  meaning that you can only set properties that are declared *  in those classes. *  When prototyping an application, using a DynamicEvent can be *  easier because you don't have to write an Event subclass *  to declare the properties in advance. *  However, you should eventually eliminate your DynamicEvents *  and write Event subclasses because these are faster and safer. *  A DynamicEvent is so flexible that the compiler can't help you *  catch your error when you set the wrong property or assign it *  a value of an incorrect type.</p> * *  <p>Example:</p> * *  <pre> *  var event:DynamicEvent = new DynamicEvent("credentialsChanged"); *  event.name = name; *  event.passsword = password; // misspelling won't be caught! *  dispatchEvent(event); *  </pre>
