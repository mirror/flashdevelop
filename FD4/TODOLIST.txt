Debugger stuff:

- Automatically stop Flash player
- Debugger holds sometimes a file ref

Known issues:

- Very limited FlexBuilder projects support
- Projects located on shared drives (completion problems, SWC parsing crash,...)

Code refactoring plans:

- Imports automatic cleanup
- Rename class file to rename in code
- Duplicate class with new name (would rename in the code too)
- For more, we need a complete AST
- Package refactoring

Flex compilation improvements:

- SWF metadata options in projects (title, description, ..)
- Framework caching

Completion improvements:

- ASCompletion exclusions settings
- Better completion support for timeline code
- Smarter function generator (detect parameters type)
- Add an option to use only package imports (com.domain.package.*)
- Inheritance explorer: display a type's super & sub classes

Snippets improvements:

- Arguments operations (uppercase, lowercase, substr, repeat,...)
- Argument to generate import declarations

Other features:

- Xml beautifier/checker
- Finish haXe projects support (platforms, directives, makefile)
- Other language completion & projects (JS, etc)
- New templates
